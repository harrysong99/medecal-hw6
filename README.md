# Homework: Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) is interested in how we can design algorithms that get better at making decisions in dynamic environments. In this homework, we'll focus on policy gradient algorithms. Reinforcement learning contains a plethora of algorithm components and types, but the policy gradient family is easier to explain and get some intuition on.
